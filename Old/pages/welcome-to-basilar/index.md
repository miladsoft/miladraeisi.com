# Welcome to My Site!

Basilar is a very easy way to get started with Markdown to HTML generation.

There are many feature rich alternatives to Basilar, go use those if you need more features.

Basilar is basic, will always be basic, but it does the job well if all you need is some basic generation and publishing.

## Features

### Content editing and URLs

Basilar supports basic pages that you add to your "pages" folder as .md files. You can either name your files the name of your posts, like "my-awesome-post.md", which will make it appear on your website as "my-awesome-post.html".

The other alternative is making folders for each post and saving the markdown as index.md. This will create friendly URLs for all your posts.

Classic markup: :wink: :crush: :cry: :tear: :laughing: :yum:

Shortcuts (emoticons): :-) :-( 8-) ;)

### Syntax highlighting

You get syntax highlight by default, so if you have any source code samples you want to share, you can use the normal syntax as you might be familiar with on GitHub repos.

```C#
using System;

namespace AmazingWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.Write("Hello World!");

            // Wait for the user to respond before closing.
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```
