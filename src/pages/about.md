Hello, I'm ✨**Milad Raeisi**✨ – a passionate software architect, developer, and UI/UX designer with a deep focus on decentralized technologies, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. With a strong dedication to building innovative solutions, I’m currently a core member of **Blockcore**, where I contribute to cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of decentralization and digital innovation.

## My Expertise

Over the years, my journey in the tech industry has led me to specialize in several key areas:

- **Blockchain Development**: I work extensively with blockchain technologies, including Bitcoin, Web3, and Decentralized Identity, to develop secure, scalable, and decentralized applications.
  
- **Software Architecture**: As a full-stack developer, I design robust and modular systems using **TypeScript**, **.NET**, **C#**, and modern APIs to ensure high performance, security, and flexibility.

- **Artificial Intelligence & Data Science**: I leverage AI and machine learning to build intelligent systems, optimizing workflows, enhancing user experiences, and driving innovation through data-driven insights.

- **UI/UX Design**: I craft intuitive, user-centric interfaces that combine functional efficiency with an engaging user experience, ensuring that every application I build is as seamless as it is powerful.

## My Current Projects

At present, I’m actively involved in several groundbreaking projects:

- **Angor** – A decentralized Bitcoin crowdfunding platform aimed at empowering creators and investors through the use of Bitcoin's decentralized network.
  
- **SeniorBlockchain Platform** – A project focused on decentralized identity solutions, which enhances security and transparency in digital interactions.

- **Open-source Contributions** – I’m a strong advocate for the open-source community, regularly contributing to projects that drive the future of blockchain and decentralized technologies forward.

## My Philosophy

I believe in the power of technology to transform the world for the better. Whether it's through building decentralized systems that ensure fairness and transparency, or leveraging AI to solve complex problems, my work is always centered on making a positive impact on society.

I am a firm believer in open-source development, as it not only democratizes access to powerful technologies but also fosters collaboration and collective innovation. It’s this philosophy that drives my passion for continuous learning and contributing to the global developer community.
